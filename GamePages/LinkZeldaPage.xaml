He is not a single character, but a person that has appeared in numerous forms across the Legend of Zelda chronology. Link is known for being one of the three Triforce pieces, notably the Triforce of Courage, due to his brave and heroic personality. Link is known for being both bold and modest, qualities that make him deserving of the Triforce of Courage. In each game, Link is depicted to have come from modest origins and to have been bullied of picked on by others at times. Others, on the other hand, are won over by Link's tenacity in his journey, and he ultimately earns their respect." FontAttributes="Bold"/>
